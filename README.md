Health &amp; Wellness Tracking

This is the start of an app I was building for a friend.  It was my first foray into backend development, so I was learning as I went.  

She eventually hired a full-time developer.  I just open sourced my code so they wouldn't need to start from scratch.  Not pretty but it works.  Enjoy!
